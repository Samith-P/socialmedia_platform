# Social Media Platform (FastAPI Learning Project)

## About This Project

This project is a **Social Media Backend** that I am building while learning **FastAPI** and modern backend development concepts.

The goal of this project is **not** to build a production-ready application, but to understand how real-world backend systems are structured and implemented.

This repository represents my **learning journey** with FastAPI.

---

## Current Status

🚧 This project is **still in progress**.

I am continuously adding new features as I learn more concepts such as authentication, database relationships, and API design.

---

## What I Am Learning Through This Project

* FastAPI fundamentals
* REST API design
* Routing and path parameters
* Request and Response models (Pydantic)
* Database integration using SQLAlchemy
* PostgreSQL connection
* JWT Authentication
* Password hashing
* Dependency Injection using `Depends`
* ORM relationships

---

## Features Implemented So Far

* User registration
* User login
* JWT-based authentication
* Password encryption
* Basic post creation
* Fetching data from database

More features will be added as I continue learning.
